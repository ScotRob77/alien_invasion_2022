# ALIEN INVASION 2022

This is a python terminal guessing game. The game is based on the classic hangman game, whereupon the user has to guess the country which the aliens are going to invade. The user has a set number of guesses to get the answer before the aliens invade.

The game is aimed at people who like guessing games and who may have an interest in the countries of the world. Due to the content younger children might get frustrated due to the knowledge of countries of the world being needed to omplete the game. With this in mind the game is suitable for players of age 10 and up.

# User Experience (UX)
* As a user I want to be able to:
    * Be able to navigate any options available
    * Understand the rules of the game
    * Have a large choice of guesses so the game doesn't repeat itself too often
    * See how many guesses I have left
    * Have a clear option to start the game again
    * Enjoy the game

# Flow Chart
* I initially created a flow chart to help me plan the game.
