# ALIEN INVASION 2022

This is a python terminal guessing game. The game is based on the classic hangman game, whereupon the user has to guess the country which the aliens are going to invade. The user has a set number of guesses to get the answer before the aliens invade.

The game is aimed at people who like guessing games and who may have an interest in the countries of the world. Due to the content younger children might get frustrated due to the knowledge of countries of the world being needed to omplete the game. With this in mind the game is suitable for players of age 10 and up.

## Welcome Screen
* This is displayed when the game starts
* It shows a UFO using ASCII art and the title of the game
* It gives the user the option to read the rules by pressing 1 or play the game by entering any other key

## Rules
* The rules are written as if they are written by the aliens who are about to invade
* They tell the user what the game is about and asks for their name
* There is also a different UFO ASCII art design

## Game
* The game starts by showing the following:
    * How many letters are in the secret word
    * The same number of dashes that are in the secret word, which is an echo to the Hangman game
    * How many guesses the user has left
    * Asks the user to guess a letter
